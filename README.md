My personal guide to Wroclaw, (latin: Wratislavia) (german: Breslau), city founded 1000 years ago by first king of Poland, Boleslaw. City that was handed over from Poland to Czechs, from Czech to Austrians, from Austria to Germans and now as one of largest polish metropolies had became a home for (hundred) thousands of migrants from Ukraine.
